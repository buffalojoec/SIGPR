# SIGPR

Here's a script I wrote for the US Office of SIGPR to help federal investigators identify 
American corporations who borrowed more than they were allowed during the corporate payroll
relief programs provided by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This Python program processed over 10 million records of data and isolated any corporations who
exceeded the borrowing limits on each type of financial assistance program.

The data processed by this program is public information and can be obtained online in CSV format.
